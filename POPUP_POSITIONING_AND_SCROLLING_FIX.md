# Popup Positioning and Scrolling Fix

## Problem Summary

Across the entire website, all popups (except the OfferPopup) were opening at the top of the screen, regardless of where the triggering button was clicked. This broke user experience and positioning logic. Additionally, popups did not support scrolling, so content got cut off on smaller screens or when customization options overflowed.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Standard Dialog Components**: Most popups used the standard `Dialog` component from Radix UI, which had fixed positioning that always centered modals at the top of the screen.

2. **Inconsistent Viewport Handling**: Different dialog components had varying levels of viewport handling and scrolling support.

3. **Overflow Restrictions**: Some modals had `overflow-hidden` which prevented proper scrolling behavior.

4. **Missing Responsive Design**: Modals didn't properly adapt to different screen sizes and content lengths.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Dialog Component (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Increased max height from `80vh` to `85vh` for better content visibility
- Added inline styles for better viewport handling:
  ```css
  maxHeight: 'calc(100vh - 2rem)',
  margin: '1rem auto'
  ```
- Improved viewport centering with proper overflow handling
- Enhanced backdrop with `backdrop-blur-sm` for better visual separation

**Key Improvements:**
- Better responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Proper scrolling support for long content
- Consistent centering regardless of viewport dimensions
- Improved mobile experience

### 2. Enhanced AlertDialog Component (`src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Applied the same viewport handling improvements as the Dialog component
- Increased max height to `85vh`
- Added consistent styling and margin handling
- Improved backdrop blur effect

**Key Improvements:**
- Consistent behavior with other dialog components
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Proper content overflow handling

### 3. Enhanced Dialog Component (`src/components/ui/enhanced-dialog.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Updated to match the improved Dialog component standards
- Increased max height to `85vh`
- Added proper viewport handling styles
- Maintained existing animation and variant support

**Key Improvements:**
- Consistent behavior across all dialog variants
- Better scrolling support for complex content
- Improved responsive design

### 4. Enhanced Contextual Dialog Component (`src/components/ui/enhanced-contextual-dialog.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Updated both contextual and traditional positioning modes
- Increased max height to `85vh` for both modes
- Added proper viewport constraints for contextual positioning
- Improved scrolling support for long content

**Key Improvements:**
- Better positioning logic for contextual popups
- Consistent scrolling behavior across positioning modes
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness

### 5. CustomizationModal Component (`src/components/CustomizationModal.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Removed `overflow-hidden` from DialogContent to enable proper scrolling
- Maintained existing ScrollArea implementation for left column
- Ensured proper viewport handling for complex customization forms

**Key Improvements:**
- Full scrolling support for customization options
- Better handling of long product customization forms
- Improved mobile experience for complex forms

## Technical Details

### Viewport Handling Strategy

1. **Container Structure:**
   ```tsx
   <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 overflow-y-auto">
     <div className="min-h-screen px-4 py-4 text-center">
       <span className="inline-block h-screen align-middle" aria-hidden="true">
         &#8203;
       </span>
       <DialogContent>
         {/* Content */}
       </DialogContent>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Responsive Constraints:**
   ```css
   max-w-[90vw] max-h-[85vh] overflow-y-auto
   maxHeight: 'calc(100vh - 2rem)'
   margin: '1rem auto'
   ```

3. **Scrolling Implementation:**
   - Outer container: `overflow-y-auto` for viewport scrolling
   - Inner content: `overflow-y-auto` for content scrolling
   - Proper height constraints to prevent overflow

### Positioning Logic

1. **Centered Positioning:**
   - Uses CSS trick with `inline-block` and `align-middle`
   - Responsive to viewport dimensions
   - Maintains proper margins and padding

2. **Contextual Positioning:**
   - Calculates optimal position based on trigger element
   - Respects viewport boundaries
   - Falls back to centered positioning when needed

3. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Adapts to smaller screens
   - Maintains usability on touch devices
   - Proper handling of virtual keyboards
